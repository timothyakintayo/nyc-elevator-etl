# NYC Elevator ELT Pipeline and Complaint Analysis

This project analyzes elevator complaints across New York City using the official NYC Open Data API. It includes a fully reproducible ELT pipeline, data cleaning, and geospatial analytics.

# Business Problem
## Business Context
Building maintenance companies in NYC need to identify high-density complaint areas to optimize service coverage and reduce response times. This analysis provides data-driven insights for strategic placement of repair hubs.

Key Questions
- What is the total elevator complaint in 2024?
- What is the average number of days taken to resolve elevator complaints in 2024?
- What is the total elevator complaint per borough and percentage?
- What is the average time taken to update the complaint created?
- What is the yearly & monthly & quarterly trends in elevator complaints?
- Which boroughs/ZIP codes have the most complaints?
- How long it takes to resolve complaints?
- What are the other highly reported service requests for expansion opportunities for the business?
- What is a suitable place/location for the headquarter (HQ)?

## Tech Stack
- Python
- DuckDB
- SQL
- Socrata API / SODA
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Docker

---

## Pipeline Steps
1. Fetch elevator complaints from NYC Open Data using API
2. Normalize and clean 50+ messy system-generated columns
3. Store results in DuckDB
4. Compute feature: `closed_in_days` (days to resolve a complaint)
5. Export data for analytics & geospatial work
